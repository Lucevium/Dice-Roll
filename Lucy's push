What if he knows?

Just as she was about to utter it, a twinge in her mind resurfaced a series of old memories. For a terrible two seconds, Gloria was drowning in the truth of her past. The thought of her own name suddenly conjured image after image—white tables and restraints, terrified, angry people screeching as she crossed the streets, a set of six Poké Balls long-since gone, and of course she remembered the picture in her desk drawer. The only item she deeply cherished, even though it haunted her. “Vivite somnium.” Live your dream.

When those two seconds passed, she looked back at Hop’s face with a rejuvenated smile. The smile surprised him for a moment. It was only a second ago when Gloria’s face was pale and bloodless with fear, but yet suddenly she was smiling. Finally, she answered his question.

“G-Gloria!” she managed, the relief of finally speaking her name somehow calming her, “Gloria Verity!”

The words exhausted her, yet there was a warmth in them that tore away the dead apathy behind her eyes, and replaced it with a liveliness she hadn’t felt in many years.

Hop grinned, “Cool! Gloria it is then!” then he laughed and shook her hand, “Nice Unovian accent you’ve got by the way! Is that where you’re from?”

She stiffened, realizing her voice could be a dead giveaway if she wasn’t careful, “More or less.”

Gloria smiled contently to herself, finally putting her squirming thoughts to rest.

That’s right, she concluded, Of course he doesn’t know me—who would know about that anyway? I’m starting a brand new life here in Galar, so I’m going to make the best of it. From this day forth, I’ll live the life I never had, and be the person I never got to be.

This time I promise—I won’t disappoint them ever again.
